## Hi, my name is Andrew Hartnett ##

I am a senior Computer Engineering student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (Class of '21). Since starting school here, I've slowly been introduced to many fields in and out of tech that I've fallen in love with. I hope to show off some research and passion projects from some of these fields in the near future.
