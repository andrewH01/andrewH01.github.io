This website serves as weekly documentation for my research in laser
injection attacks and defenses in FGPA hardware. The research is being
conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the SPQR at
the University of Michigan. Professors Wayne Burleson and Kevin Fu
both oversee the project, with help from Takeshi Sugawara from the
University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan.
